# Familiarity-Things-I-never-like-about-my-hometown
Things that I am so familiar with yet so bored of. 
Things that I often overlook despite their visibility. 
Things that are mundane yet they have warmed my soul.
…

{ ––Familiarity: Things I Never Like About My Hometown–– } shelters my profound reflections on the land of my birth and upbringing – a peaceful, leisurely coastal city in Southern Vietnam. This publication intertwines footage of my hometown, writings and languages, crafting a rich tapestry of poetic interpretations that are imprinted with my personal perspective. 
The poetic narrative and visual imagery aim to evoke a sense of longing and belonging, whilst also critiquing the flaws and banalities of my hometown. Through this inter-sensory exploration, I hope to challenge the conventional perceptions on the often–overlooked charms and provoke introspection about human relationship with their place of origin.
